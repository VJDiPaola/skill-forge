# Viewport Fit Checks

Reference for the `playwright-interactive` skill. Required before signoff on any interactive UI task.

Do not assume a screenshot is acceptable just because the main widget is visible. Before signoff, explicitly verify that the intended initial view matches the product requirement, using both screenshot review and numeric checks.

## Rules

- Define the intended initial view before signoff. For scrollable pages, this is the above-the-fold experience. For app-like shells, games, editors, dashboards, or tools, this is the full interactive surface plus the controls and status needed to use it.
- Use screenshots as the primary evidence for fit. Numeric checks support the screenshots; they do not overrule visible clipping.
- Signoff fails if any required visible region is clipped, cut off, obscured, or pushed outside the viewport in the intended initial view, even if page-level scroll metrics appear acceptable.
- Scrolling is acceptable when the product is designed to scroll and the initial view still communicates the core experience and exposes the primary call to action or required starting context.
- For fixed-shell interfaces, scrolling is not an acceptable workaround if it is needed to reach part of the primary interactive surface or essential controls.
- Do not rely on document scroll metrics alone. Fixed-height shells, internal panes, and hidden-overflow containers can clip required UI while page-level scroll checks still look clean.
- Check region bounds, not just document bounds. Verify that each required visible region fits within the viewport in the startup state.
- For Electron or desktop apps, verify both the launched window size and placement and the renderer's initial visible layout before any manual resize or repositioning.
- Passing viewport-fit checks only proves that the intended initial view is visible without unintended clipping or scrolling. It does not prove that the UI is visually correct or aesthetically successful.

## Web or renderer check

```javascript
console.log(await page.evaluate(() => ({
  innerWidth: window.innerWidth,
  innerHeight: window.innerHeight,
  clientWidth: document.documentElement.clientWidth,
  clientHeight: document.documentElement.clientHeight,
  scrollWidth: document.documentElement.scrollWidth,
  scrollHeight: document.documentElement.scrollHeight,
  canScrollX: document.documentElement.scrollWidth > document.documentElement.clientWidth,
  canScrollY: document.documentElement.scrollHeight > document.documentElement.clientHeight,
})));
```

## Electron check

```javascript
console.log(await appWindow.evaluate(() => ({
  innerWidth: window.innerWidth,
  innerHeight: window.innerHeight,
  clientWidth: document.documentElement.clientWidth,
  clientHeight: document.documentElement.clientHeight,
  scrollWidth: document.documentElement.scrollWidth,
  scrollHeight: document.documentElement.scrollHeight,
  canScrollX: document.documentElement.scrollWidth > document.documentElement.clientWidth,
  canScrollY: document.documentElement.scrollHeight > document.documentElement.clientHeight,
})));
```

Augment the numeric check with `getBoundingClientRect()` checks for the required visible regions in your specific UI when clipping is a realistic failure mode; document-level metrics alone are not sufficient for fixed shells.
